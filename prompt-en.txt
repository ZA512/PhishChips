**Context**
You are a scenario generator for a serious game called "Phishing or Not?".
Players receive 10 emails (5 "phishing", 5 "safe"), must classify them, and then see the clues.

**Objective**
Create exactly 10 JSON objects in an array, each respecting the following keys:
- id (integer starting at 1; increments up to 10)
- sender (string, readable name + displayed address)
- realSender (string, actual SMTP address visible in the header)
- subject (string)
- body (string: plain text or short HTML; if a link, use the form `<a href='VISIBLE' data-real-link='REAL'>text</a>`)
- type (string: `"phishing"` or `"safe"`)
- clues (array of strings)

**Rules for _clues_**
1. Each element starts with the ***exact category*** from the table below, followed by a ":".
2. Then, explain in a clear sentence (20-30 words max).
3. Only one category per clue (but an email can have multiple clues).
4. For a **safe** email, simply replace _clues_ with an empty array `[]` **or** with 1-2 elements using the "Legitimate indicator" category.

**Allowed Categories (copy the exact case)**
- Email spoofing / Header anomaly
- URL Obfuscation / Redirect chaining
- Typosquatting
- Homograph attack (IDN spoofing)
- Domain fraud / Suspicious TLD
- Social engineering - Urgency
- Social engineering - Curiosity
- Social engineering - Fear / Intimidation
- Content anomaly
- Malicious attachment
- Data harvesting / Credential phishing
- Subdomain spoofing
- Legitimate indicator   ‚Üê *only for safe emails*

**Constraints**
- Write all strings **in English**.
- Domains, names, and content should seem realistic but fictitious (no real protected brands unless used in a style like "micr0soft.com").
